Optimize the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) by predicting the zone where the Maximum Power Point could lie using Machine Learning
Under partial shading conditions, photovoltaic (PV) modules in a solar array experience varying irradiance. A Global Maximum (GM) and multiple Local Maximums (LMs) can originate on the Power-Voltage (P-V) curve under such nonuniform irradiance conditions. 
Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms are built to overcome the drawbacks of the existing MPPT algorithms.
